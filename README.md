These Repo contains all the 3 Python Graded projects Completed with Assignment 2 as zip file and other two as test file 
**Assignment 1**
This script defines a check_password_strength function that checks the password against the specified criteria and returns a boolean indicating whether the password 
meets the criteria. 
The main function takes user input for a password and provides feedback based on the strength of the password.
**Assignment 2**
We have to install  psutil library installed in your Python environment using pip install psutil command. This program will keep running until you manually interrupt it (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C).

Adjust the cpu_threshold variable to your desired threshold value. The program will check the CPU usage every second, and if it exceeds the threshold, it will display an alert message
**Assignment 4**
execute this command below to copy and backup file 
python backup.py "/path/to/source" "/path/to/destination"
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read from the source directory and write to the destination directory. The script will handle directory existence and file name collisions gracefully, 
ensuring that backups are created with unique names in the destination directory.
